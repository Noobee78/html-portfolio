<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>Im a proud U.S. Army veteran turned Vetpreneur, passionate about building innovative solutions through software development. My military background taught me discipline, adaptability, and problem-solving under pressure—skills I now apply to tech entrepreneurship. Whether it's crafting a new app or developing tools to streamline operations, 
  I thrive on solving real-world problems through code and creativity.</p>

<p>My love for technology goes beyond just building—its a full-time curiosity. I enjoy diving into articles, podcasts, and case studies about emerging tech trends, from AI and drones to Web3 and beyond.
   Staying ahead of the curve keeps me sharp and fuels the ideas behind the software solutions Im developing.</p>

<p>Outside of the screen, Im a huge fan of video games, animals, and combat sports. I train in Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu and follow MMA closely, always drawn to the strategy, discipline, and heart behind the fight. Whether I’m gaming, rolling on the mats, or spending time with animals, 
  I bring passion, focus, and a drive to always keep learning and evolving.</p>
